        <p id="about_me"><span> I am a 3rd year student at the University of Califorina, Irvine majoring in Computer Science
            with a focus in Intelligent Systems.

            I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in human interaction with computers. This has lead
            me down a path of writing programs that can recognize confused facial expressions and evenutally integrating
            my Google Home assistant into my daily life to efficently go about my day. I hope to gain more experience
            professionally and grow outside the classroom. I am currently proficient in C++ and Python. Feel free to
            reach out as I have provided my LinkedIn profile and Github below!</span></p>
